Welcome! I am a software engineer at Kinetik Healthcare Solutions, a US-based healthcare startup, where I am building an Uber-like iOS application for patient transportation, working remotely from Bangladesh. I earned my BSc in Computer Science and Engineering from Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology. For my undergraduate thesis, I focused on natural language processing, experimenting with the integration of handcrafted features and transformers for low-resource languages. Outside of my job, I actively engage in research projects and have presented our findings at several conferences.

Throughout my undergrad and high school years, I immersed myself in mathematical and programming competitions, investing nearly 10,000 hours over 7 years to strengthen my logical and analytical abilities. I solved thousands of programming problemsets and participated in many programming competitions. I also represented my university in the International Collegiate Programming Competition, achieving notable ranks in the Asia West Region. These experiences helped me develop problem-solving skills and a deep hunger for tackling challenging problems that require perseverance, patience, and grit.
